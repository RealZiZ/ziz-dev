# Profile Image Setup

To display your profile picture on the website, please add your image file to this `public` folder.

## Required Files

Place your profile picture as one of these filenames:
- `profile.jpg` (preferred)
- `profile.png` (fallback)

The website will automatically try `profile.jpg` first, then fall back to `profile.png` if the first one doesn't exist.

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended Size**: 512x512 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading

The image will be displayed in circular frames with neon blue borders and glow effects throughout the website:
- Small avatar in the navbar
- Large profile picture on the Home page
- Profile picture on the About page
